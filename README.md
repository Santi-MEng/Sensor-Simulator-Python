# Sensor Monitoring Simulation in Python

A Python-based simulation system that mimics real-time monitoring of temperature, gas, and voltage sensors. Built for learning test automation, GUI development, and alert handling. 

## Features

- Simulates random sensor data (temperature, gas level, voltage)
- Defines safe thresholds and triggers alerts if exceeded
- Displays live status in a graphical interface using Tkinter
- Logs all alerts to a log file (`alerts.log`)
- Includes unit tests for sensor-checking logic (`pytest`)
- Stop button to halt real-time monitoring

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – GUI display
- **pytest** – Unit testing
- **logging** – System alert log
- **modular scripts** – for sensors, logic, alerts, and UI
